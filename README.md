We will be using this repo to integrate all the modules.


## Project Description
DineOut is an **Android app** that allows its users to keep track of their journey experiences by allowing them to save their journeys in the form of a trip diary and have all their travel experiences saved at one place. Its more of a **Check-in** application. In order to spice things up, we gave this app a **social platform** feel by allowing the user to add friends and share his profile containing journeys count and friends count with each other.

## Functionalities

DineOut uses **Firebase Phone Number Authentication** which verifies a user‚Äôs phone number by sending a code to it. The user is then authenticated to use the app.

Our app also has a **Journeys Map** which has journeys as labels placed on locations which have been visited.

The app incorporates a **Step Count** feature which allows the travellers to count the number of steps they took while being on a journey. It also incorporates a **Compass using Magnetic Sensors** which proves helpful for travellers while travelling.

In order to make the app usable for a wide range of audiences, our app supports **language support in Urdu**. We have also added **Text-to-Speech** feature by reading the journey title and description for users with some disabilities. Moreover, our app can also be used using **Voice Commands**. The user speaks the command and our app recognizes the command e.g Exit App will close the app. 

Wanderlust seamlessly incorporates **Social Media Integration using Facebook and Twitter APIs**. This allows users to share their journey experiences on these social platforms. 

Moreover, the app also incorporates **Google Admob** with customized ads for targeting travellers. We have also integrated **Firebase Analytics** which allows us to have deeper insights into how a user uses our apps so that we can use those insights and improve our app.

Wanderlust was designed with **major focus on HCI**. It incorporates **Ben Shneiderman‚Äôs 'Golden Rules of Interface Design'** including

* Consistency
* Design Dialogs to Yield Closure
* Offer Informative Feedback
* Prevention of Errors
* Keep Users in Control
* Reduce Cognitive Load
* Universal Usability

Moreover the **modern UI/UX guidelines for Android App Design** have been followed including:

* Visibility (making features visible to user, used Bottom Navigation Bar)
* Splash Screens
* Audio Feedback using Text to Speech
* Enhanced Accessibility Using Google Maps

The attached presentation ‚Äò**Wanderlust-Rules**‚Äô explains how our app utilized these HCI rules in our interfaces.
